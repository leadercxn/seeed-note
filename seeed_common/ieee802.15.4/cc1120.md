    + Synchronous Serial Mode:  enabled by setting PKT_CFG2.PKT_FORMAT = 1.
    + Transparent Serial Mode:                     PKT_CFG2.PKT_FORMAT = 11b

* Receive Configuration
    + CHAN_BW.ADC_CIC_DECFACT and CHAN_BW.BB_CIC_DECFACT register fields control the RX filter BW
    + Preamble Detection: PREAMBLE_CFG0.PQT_EN = 1
    + Preamble quality threshold PREAMBLE_CFG0.PQT
    + MODEM_STATUS1.PQT_REACHED to check  recv preamble quality

    * Collision Detector 碰撞检测，遇到一个信号比现在更强的数据包
        + no handle
        + RX can be terminated and resumed later. 终止，稍厚再恢复
        + be restarted to receive the new packet.
    
    * Clear Channel Assessment (CCA)
        + PKT_CFG2.CCA_MODE selects the mode to use when determining CCA.
            1. Always (CCA disabled, always goes to TX)
            2. If RSSI is below threshold
            3. Unless currently receiving a packet
            4. RSSI below threshold and not currently receiving a packet
            5. If RSSI is below threshold and ETSI LBT [2] requirements are met

    * PKT_CFG2.CCA_MODE = 100b (LBT) 
            1.  HW support to automate the LBT algorithm, including random back-offs.
            2. If the radio controller is in RX when the STX or SFSTXON command strobes are used, the TX-on-CCA function will be used. 

    * Link Quality Indicator (LQI)
        + PKT_CFG1.APPEND_STATUS  is enabled
        + be read from the LQI_VAL register

* Transmit Configuration
    + Output Power = ((PA_CFG2.PA_POWER_RAMP)+1)/2 - 18 dBm
        PA_CFG2.PA_POWER_RAMP

    + PKT_CFG1.APPEND_STATUS = 1 （default）
        | 前导码 | sync | payload | rssi | crc + lqi （1B） ｜  ｜
    
    + Standard Packet Format
        Preamble bits （8*n bit）PREAMBLE_CFG1.NUM_PREAMBLE + Synchronization word (max 32 bit) SYNC_CFG0.SYNC_MODE ≠ 0 + Optional length byte (1B) + Optional address byte (1B) + Payload + Optional 2 byte CRC（PKT_CFG1.CRC_CFG）
    Preamble bits && Synchronization word && Optional 2 byte CRC is Inserted automatically in TX,processed and removed in RX

    + fixed packet length protocols
        - Fixed packet length mode is selected by setting PKT_CFG0.LENGTH_CONFIG = 00. The desired packet length is set by the PKT_LEN register.
        - n bytes + m bits , n = PKT_LEN , m = PKT_CFG0.PKT_BIT_LEN . If m ≠ 0, only m bits of the last byte written to the TX FIFO is transmitted and RX mode is terminated when the last m bits of the packet is received. CRC is not supported when PKT_CFG0.PKT_BIT_LEN ≠ 0

    + variable packet length protocols
        - PKT_CFG0.LENGTH_CONFIG = 01
        - packet length is configured by the first byte after the sync word = Optional address byte (1B) + Payload
        - PKT_LEN register is used to set the maximum packet length allowed in RX

    + Infinite Packet Length
        - PKT_CFG0.LENGTH_CONFIG = 10
        * Arbitrary Length Field Configuration

        * Packet Length > 255

    + Packet Filtering in Receive Mode
        * Address Filtering
            - PKT_CFG1.ADDR_CHECK_CFG
                + PKT_CFG1.ADDR_CHECK_CFG = 10b , in addition check against the 0x00 broadcast address, or both the 0x00 and 0xFF broadcast addresses
                + PKT_CFG1.ADDR_CHECK_CFG = 11b, eceived address matches a valid address, the packet is received and written into the RX FIFO
                + RFEND_CFG0.TERM_ON_BAD_PACKET_EN , detmeter how to do after recv a bad packet
            - DEV_ADDR reg is the addr filter
        * Maximum Length Filtering
            - if PKT_CFG0.LENGTH_CONFIG = 01b ,  If the received length byte has a larger value than this, the packet is discarded
        * CRC Filtering
            - The filtering of a packet when CRC check fails is enabled by setting FIFO_CFG.CRC_AUTOFLUSH = 1. The CRC auto flush function will only flush the packet received with bad CRC, other packets will remain unchanged in the RX FIFO. After auto flushing the faulty packet
        * Auto Acknowledge
    
    + 
        - RX termination based on CS can be used even if the RX termination timer is not used (RFEND_CFG1.RX_TIME = 111b)
